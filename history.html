<H2>SCHEDULE</H2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <p>The final draw is scheduled to take place in April 2022, for now, we wait.

The match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July 2020. The opening match, featuring the hosts Qatar, will be played on 21 November 2022, 13:00 local time, at the Al Bayt Stadium. During the group stage, four matches will be played on each day, with kick-off times being 13:00, 16:00, 19:00 and 22:00 for the first two rounds, and 18:00 and 22:00 for the simultaneous kick-offs of the last round and for knockout stage matches. The third place match will be played on 17 December 2022 at the Khalifa International Stadium, and the final will be played on 18 December 2022 at the Lusail Iconic Stadium, both at 18:00.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="column">
    <p> Unlike previous tournaments where the match venues and kick-off times for each fixture are set prior to the draw, the assignment of group fixtures for each matchday to a specific venue and kick-off time will only be made after the group stage draw, which will be held after the March 2022 international match window, and the teams of each specific fixture are known. This is possible due to the close proximity of the venues which will allow the organizers to optimize stadium allocation for spectators and kick-off times for television audience The group stage matches for each group will be allocated to the following stadiums:

Groups A, B, E, F: Al Bayt Stadium, Khalifa International Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium, Al Rayyan Stadium
Groups C, D, G, H: Lusail Iconic Stadium, Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, Education City Stadium, Al Janoub Stadium
*Qualified Teams are still To Be Determined.</p>
