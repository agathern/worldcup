<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to be the 22nd edition of the FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international men's association football championship contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA. It is scheduled to take place in Qatar from 21 November to 18 December 2022. This will be the first World Cup ever to be held in the Arab world and the first in a Muslim-majority country.
    This will be the second World Cup held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. However due to Qatar's intense summer heat, this World Cup will be held from late-November to mid-December, making it the first to not be held in May, June, or July. It is to be played in a reduced timeframe of 28 days.</p>

<H2>LOCATIONS AND VENUES</H2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <p>It's official- The 2022 match will be held in Qatar. 
  As they are still in process of wrapping up to build the stadiums, multiple things have been taken in consideration while constructiong the venyes. Stadiums aim to employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 °C (36 °F), and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure. 

  The country intends for the stadiums to reflect the historical and cultural aspects of Qatar. Each stadium will incorporate four priorities, which are legacy, comfort, accessibility and sustainability. Qatar aims to build the stadiums with the highest sustainability and environmental standards. The stadiums will be equipped with cooling systems that are environmentally friendly overcoming the challenging environmental nature of the country. </p>

  <div class="column">
    <p> The plan is to build Zero Waste stadiums using environmentally friendly materials, harmless equipment, and ecologically sustainable solutions through the implementation of renewable and low energy solutions. Qatar aspires to be compliant and certified by the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) for all the world cup stadiums. All of the five stadium projects launched have been designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners. Leading football clubs in Europe wanted the World Cup to take place from 28 April to 29 May rather than the typical June and July staging, due to concerns about the heat.</p>

<H2>SCHEDULE</H2>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <p>The final draw is scheduled to take place in April 2022, for now, we wait.

The match schedule was confirmed by FIFA in July 2020. The opening match, featuring the hosts Qatar, will be played on 21 November 2022, 13:00 local time, at the Al Bayt Stadium. During the group stage, four matches will be played on each day, with kick-off times being 13:00, 16:00, 19:00 and 22:00 for the first two rounds, and 18:00 and 22:00 for the simultaneous kick-offs of the last round and for knockout stage matches. The third place match will be played on 17 December 2022 at the Khalifa International Stadium, and the final will be played on 18 December 2022 at the Lusail Iconic Stadium, both at 18:00.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="column">
    <p> Unlike previous tournaments where the match venues and kick-off times for each fixture are set prior to the draw, the assignment of group fixtures for each matchday to a specific venue and kick-off time will only be made after the group stage draw, which will be held after the March 2022 international match window, and the teams of each specific fixture are known. This is possible due to the close proximity of the venues which will allow the organizers to optimize stadium allocation for spectators and kick-off times for television audience The group stage matches for each group will be allocated to the following stadiums:

Groups A, B, E, F: Al Bayt Stadium, Khalifa International Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium, Al Rayyan Stadium
Groups C, D, G, H: Lusail Iconic Stadium, Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, Education City Stadium, Al Janoub Stadium
*Qualified Teams are still To Be Determined.</p>
